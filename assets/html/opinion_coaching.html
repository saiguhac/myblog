			<p>It’s the Indian Dream, isn’t it?
				<br>The Indian parents’ dream. To see their kids make it to an IIT. And then get a job, probably in the US. Things are changing now, but the basic template is still the same, and probably will be, for quite some time.<br>
			</p>
		
			<p>But this system is awash with flaws.<br></p>

			<p>Let me reiterate: I am not attempting to argue for or against coaching centres. I’m merely attempting to point out the numerous flaws in this highly unregulated system.</p>

			<p>In this editorial, I ask and attempt to answer 2 questions, admittedly the first one better than the second <br>
				-	What’s wrong with the way it is now? <br>
				-	What do we do about it?<br>
			</p>

Here’s what we can say for sure about what’s wrong with the way it is now.

<p><strong>1.There is absolutely no set of laws which govern coaching institutions.</strong><br><br>
	
	
			A <a href="http://assocham.org/newsdetail.php?id=4050 ">report</a> published by 
				<a href="http://assocham.org/index.php"><strong>The Associated Chambers of Commerce & Industry of India</strong></a>  in 2013 said that coaching 348 million-dollar industry in India and expected to touch 587-million by 2015. It hit 4 billion USD in 2018[Citation needed, source: The Quint]<br>This is the year 2018. An estimate made by the India Today Group  suggested that the turn over for the city of Kota from the coaching industry alone, for the year 2017-18, is 220 million USD. To be fair, that estimate included the revenue generated by food and accommodation as well, but yet, that number is staggering. Now, if there were any problems with this industry,  they are easily solved if you write to the <a href="#">National Coaching Centre Regulatory Authority of India</a>. Except that doesn't exist. i just made that up<br></p>
		
		<ul>
	
		<li>That’s right. Corporations are regulated by The Companies Act (Amended 2013), banks by the Banking Regulation Act (Originally enacted 1949) and even Private schools by the 2009 RTE Act, and so on.<br>
		But coaching centres, being a very recent phenomenon, have no act of parliament to regulate them. Although, to be fair, even a large number of school policies are still regulated only by state laws. But there are some standards set by the central government in the case of private schools.<br><br></li>
		<li>All in all, this means that there are very few things illegal in a coaching institution. 
		Yes, students need to be registered in a school to pass their twelfth class, which is necessary for most colleges, and the CBSE claims that it doesn’t approve of coaching institutions; but there is no law against how a coaching centre functions, especially with the up-and-coming integrated coaching practice (which isn’t as up-and-coming now, it’s become pretty prevalent) taking the limelight. <br><br></li>
		<li>Now, to be fair, on at least five occasions, various members of parliament attempted to introduce bills to regulate coaching centres. But on all five occasions, the bill was introduced by private members, and is pending in three cases, has lapsed in one, and was removed in another. (The member who removed her bill introduced a fresh bill a couple of years later.) <br>The wording of these bills, while not perfect, could have worked as a start for regulating such private institutions. But as a whole, the parliament isn’t ready to take a stance on the issue, and at this point, it’s not hard to understand why this is so. <br><br></li>
		
	
</ul>






	<strong>2. These institutions are obsessed with results and use the law of large numbers to win.<br></strong>
		<ul>
	<li>All coaching institutes, from the ones in Kota, to the ones in Andhra Pradesh to the other corporations in cities need results. Some of them are, admittedly, less taxing than others, but they instil a sense of competition in their students, making them aspire to be in the top batch with the best teachers, while not focussing on the batches below and not providing them with good teachers. This is a method they use to keep their success rate high, while at the same time keep the cash flowing in. <br><br></li>
	<li>They inevitably manage to garner attention with some results their students obtain, and there are even allegations that these institutions buy ranks from students who passed the exams themselves or passed it through a small unrecognised coaching centre. Last year alone, around 1.40 lakh students enrolled for engineering courses in Kota alone, which is a staggering number.<br><br></li>
</ul>


	<strong> 3.	This obsession with results affects the students, who come under intense pressure to deliver results.</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>The Tata Institute for Social Sciences (TISS) is working on a report on the city of Kota right now, at the request of the Rajasthan government, and its findings state that the number of reported suicides was 58 since 2013. Note that this is the number of reported suicides, excluding attempts, so these numbers are only the low bar. There have been 10 suicided as of June 14 in city of Kota in the year 2018 alone. There’s another issue to be addressed here. <br><br></li>
		<li>Harvard University accepts 54 out of 1000 applicants. MIT? 79. Oxford? 175. All the IIT’S? 9.2. That’s right. For every 1000 people who apply, 9 are selected. <br><br> The total number of people appearing for mains is a staggering 12 lakh. In all fairness, this number includes all the people who appear for JEE Mains and might include students who want to go to NIT’s, but even taking other factors into account, these numbers are staggering. <br><br></li>
		<li>Additionally, with the rise in private education and the complete fall of the public-school system, more and more parents are depending on coaching centres to educate their children. And while some of these centres are small scale, low pressure coaching classes, many of them, especially the ones in Andhra Pradesh and Kota, are designed as factories, meant to take in students, push them to maximum extreme they can, and send them out the other side. <br>Some of them make to IIT’S, NIT’S, and good medical colleges, while the others don’t. After this, they rinse and repeat, without any regard for the kind of effect this routine has on the student’s life. </li>
		<li>This is a clip from a news report after a suicide which took place just this March. The father, almost at once, dismisses the suicides and claims foul play and murder.<br><br><iframe width="400" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cTMrABKA4kY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>Note that he says that he’d spoken to his son just the day before and that all was fine. That brings us to another problem. He really doesn’t know that. Contact with parents’ wanes after the student’s life at Kota begins.<br><br></li>
		<li>While Kota is relatively less strict on that issue, coaching centres across Andhra Pradesh, which are standalone and have their hostel in the same building as the classrooms do not allow cell phones and allow calls with parents once a week, and many students don’t tell their parents what’s actually going on there. <br><br></li>
		<li>Kota reaches the other end of the spectrum, with little to no adult supervision for the students. Drug and alcohol abuse is rampant, with the TISS report finding that students have resorted to smoking (7%), alcohol (8%) and drug abuse (5%) among students.<br><br></li>
	</ul>


	<strong>The point is, I could get into the problems that this system generates, this could take a while. <br>This includes</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The batch system leaves a lot of aspirants behind, stuffing them in a highly competitive class of 300 students and expecting them to compete with students who are given much better teachers.<br><br></li>
		<li>The fact that the concept of Paying Guests, another highly unregulated accommodation option overcharges residents with rates that go as high as Rs. 8 for one unit of electricity.<br><br></li>
		<li>The messes buy vegetables at night from the vendors, when they’re almost rotten, and have no health inspections and cook in highly unhygienic environments.<br><br></li>
		<li>FIITJEE, one of the more reputed institutes, has been <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/iit-moves-hc-on-metro-stn-naming/articleshow/64336452.cms">sued by IIT-Delhi</a> for painting their logo at the IIT-D metro station.<br><br></li>
		
		<li>And all of this doesn’t even begin to cover the problems in institutions in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, which serve poor food, micro manage every single instant of a ward’s life and allow very little parent-child contact.<br><br></li>
	</ul>




<p>Data for coaching centres across Andhra Pradesh is absent, because they don’t operate under a consolidated economy like Kota does, and the government doesn’t recognise coaching institutes for what they are, because recognising them would mean accepting that they have a problem in the way they function, and that could impact a 4 Billion USD industry.</p>
<p>The acceptance rate for IIT exams was 3% in 2011. Now, it’s 0.92. In fact, it has been dropping for a long time now.</p> 


<strong>All of this leads us to the big question. What do we do about it?</strong>
	<br><br>

<p>We can’t expect the government to enact legislation to regulate coaching institutions in a day. Hell, they’ve had a long time and haven’t budged on the subject. <br>
<em><strong>What can we do? </strong></em><br><br>
I’m not so sure myself. I’ve got a few ideas, though.
	<br><br>

First, and most importantly, we begin increasing awareness of this rigged rat-race to parents and students across the country. Elements of this system are becoming have become the norm. And the first step to solving a problem is realising there is one. 
	<br>

There are many reasons why students/parents choose coaching centres. And many of them are valid, like the fact that the public education is, in many places, sub-par and private education is very expensive. So, they’d rather prefer spending their money on an institute which will get their kid into college as well. 
<br>
All the more reason coaching centres must be recognised by the government and regulated. It’s truly a sad time when the government fails to even accept the fact that these centres have paved the way for a very self-destructive system that affects many lives. 
<br>
Write to the Lok Sabha. Write your story to journals and newspapers, ask them to publish it. In a time when the government is ready to spend over 4300 crores on publicity, they can afford to listen to the problems they like to pretend don’t exist.
